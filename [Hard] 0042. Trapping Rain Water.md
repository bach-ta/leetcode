# 42. Trapping Rain Water (Hard)
[https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

- Use DP. `ans[i]` is the amount of water trapped so far at index `i`. `peak` is the index of the highest bar so far.
- For each bar `i`:
    + If `h[i] <= h[i-1]`, the current bar is lower than the previous bar, so it cannot trap any more water than the previous bar. `ans[i] = ans[i-1]`.
    + If `h[i] >= h[peak]`, the current bar is at least as high as the highest bar so far. The area between `peak` and `i` will be trapped with height = `peakHeight = min(peakHeight, curHeight)`. Set `ans[i] = ans[peak] + area_between_peak_and_i`. Then set `peak = i`.
    + If `h[i] < h[peak]`, the current bar is lower than the highest bar so far. Go back from `i` to find the first `j` (i.e. max index `j`) s.t. `h[j] >= h[i]`. The area between `j` and `i` will be trapped with height = `h[i]`. Set `ans[i] = ans[j] + area_between_j_and_i`.

```python
def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(height)
    ans = [0] * n
    peak = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        if height[i] <= height[i-1]:
            ans[i] = ans[i-1]
        elif height[i] >= height[peak]:
            ans[i] = ans[peak]
            trapHeight = height[peak]
            for m in range(peak+1, i):
                ans[i] += trapHeight - height[m]
            peak = i
        else:
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and height[j] < height[i]:
                j -= 1
            ans[i] = ans[j]
            trapHeight = height[i]
            for m in range(j+1, i):
                ans[i] += trapHeight - height[m]
            
    return ans[n-1]
```
