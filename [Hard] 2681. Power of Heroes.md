# [2681. Power of Heroes (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-heroes/)

- Use the "contribution" idea. For a number `x`, how much does `x` contribute to the final answer if `x` is used as the max of a group? It is `x^2 * k`, where `k` is the sum of all possible `min` number in all subsequences (multisets) that have `x` as the max.
- Now let `x_1, x_2, ..., x_p` be the numbers in the array that is strictly smaller than `x`. Note that these elements can contain duplicates.
- First, notice that `[x]` is a multiset that has `x` as both the max and the min. So `x` contributes `x` to `k`.
- For `x_p`, the only multiset that has `x` as the max and `x_p` as the min is `[x_p, x]`. So `x_p` contributes `x_p` to `k`.
- For `x_{p-1}`, the multisets that have `x` as the max and `x_{p-1}` as the min are `[x_{p-1}, x]` and `[x_{p-1}, x_p, x]`. So `x_{p-1}` contributes `x_{p-1} * 2` to `k`.
- ...
- For `x_i`, for any multiset that has `x` as the max and `x_i` as the min, between `x_i` and `x`, we can have any subset of `{x_{i+1}, ..., x_p}`. So `x_i` contributes `x_i * 2^{p-i}` to `k`.
- So `x_1, x_2, ..., x_p` contributes $s = \sum\limits_{i=1}^p x_i \cdot 2^{p-i}$ to `k`.
- Thus, assuming that `nums` is sorted, for each `i in [0, n - 1]`, `ans += nums[i] ^ 2 * k`, where `k` = `nums[i] + (nums[i-1] + 2 * nums[i-2] + 4 * nums[i-3] + ...)`.
- For each `x`, we can calculate `k` in constant time if we store the previous `k`. So the total time complexity is `O(n log n) (sorting) + O(n) (1 pass) = O(n log n)`.

```python
def sumOfPower(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    ans = s = 0
    nums.sort()
    
    for x in nums:
        ans += (x ** 2 * (s + x)) % MOD
        ans %= MOD
        s = s * 2 + x
    return ans
```
