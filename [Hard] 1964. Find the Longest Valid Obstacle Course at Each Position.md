# 1964. Find the Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position (Hard)

- Longest non-decreasing subsequence.
- If using the O(n^2) DP solution, then the answer is the `dp` array itself, but this will cause TLE.
- Use O(n*logn) approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on2hvxBXJH4.

```python
def longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(self, ob: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(ob)
    p, ans = [], []
    # p[i] = top element on pile i (0-indexed). For each pile i, the answer for all elements in pile i is i+1

    for i in range(n):
        l, r = 0, len(p)

        # find the first pile whose top element is strictly greater than the current number, then put the current number on top of that pile
        while l < r:
            m = (l + r) >> 1
            if ob[i] < p[m]: # < is for non-decreasing; for SRICTLY increasing, use <=
                r = m
            else:
                l = m+1
        if l == len(p): # if the current number is greater than all top elements, then create a new pile
            p.append(ob[i])
        else:
            p[l] = ob[i]
        ans.append(l+1)

    return ans
```
