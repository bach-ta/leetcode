# 1434. Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other (Hard)

Use bitmask to represent the people who have been assigned a hat
- If all people have been assigned a hat, then return 1.
- If there are no more hats to assign, then return 0.
- First, count the number of ways without assigning the current hat.
- Then, for each person who prefers the current hat, if the person has not been assigned a hat, then count the number of ways to assign the current hat to the current person.

```python
def numberWays(self, hats: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    d, n = defaultdict(list), len(hats)
    for person, prefered_hats in enumerate(hats):
        for hat in prefered_hats:
            d[hat].append(person)
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def count(mask, hat): # mask: bitmask of assigned hats, hat: current hat to assign
        if mask == (1 << n) - 1: # all hats are assigned
            return 1
        if hat > 40: # no more hats to assign
            return 0
        res = count(mask, hat + 1) # first, count the number of ways without assigning the current hat
        for person in d[hat]:
            if mask & (1 << person) == 0: # current person has not been assigned a hat, i.e. not in the mask
                res += count(mask | (1 << person), hat + 1) # += number of ways to assign the current hat to the current person
        return res % (10**9 + 7)
    
    return count(0, 1)
```
