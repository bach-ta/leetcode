# 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary (Hard)

Use DP:
- `dp[i][j]` is # of ways to form the first i chars of target from the first j indexes of words
- For each char from a-z, record the occurences at each index.
- Base case: `dp[0][*] = 1`: there is 1 way to form the empty string from any given index set.
- Recurrence: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (num of words s.t. w[j-1] = target[i-1])`, i.e. (already formed by prev indexes) or (take current index (`j-1`) of `words` to form the `i`-th char of `target`).

```python
def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n, m = len(target), len(words[0])
    dp = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    charCount = [[0] * m for _ in range(26)]

    for w in words:
        for i in range(m):
            numForm = ord(w[i]) - ord('a')
            charCount[numForm][i] += 1

    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1): # for each char in target
        for j in range(i, m+1): # for each index of words
            dp[0][j] = 1
            numForm = ord(target[i-1]) - ord('a')
            match = charCount[numForm][j-1]
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] + (dp[i-1][j-1] * match) % MOD) % MOD

    return dp[n][m]
```
