# 141. Linked List Cycle (Easy)

1. Use two pointers, one moves one step at a time, the other moves two steps at a time.
2. Loop until the two pointers meet or the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
3. If the two pointers meet (before the slow pointer reaches the end of the list), then there is a cycle. Otherwise, there is no cycle.

```python
def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    fast, slow = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        if fast == slow:
            return True
    return False
```
