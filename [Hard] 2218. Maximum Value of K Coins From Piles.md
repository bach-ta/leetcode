# 2218. Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles (Hard)

Convert to 0-1 knapsack problem.

Each coin represents an item:
- weight = # of coins from top (incl. self).
- value = sum of coin values from top of pile (incl. self).

Proceed as normal 0-1 knapsack but with a caveat:
- In any config, 2 items in the knapsack cannot correspond to 2 coins in the same pile
- Just need to modify the recurrence a bit:
    compare with `dp[i - cw][w - cw] + cv`, instead of `dp[i - 1][w - cw] + cv`.
- This work since `cw` also serves as the offset from the last item of prev pile.
- So the order of inserting items to vector in the 'convert' step is IMPORTANT: coins in each pile must be added contiguously, from index 1 to last (the relative order of piles processed is irrelevant).

```cpp
int maxValueOfCoins(vector<vector<int>>& piles, int k) {
    vector<int> weight, value;

    // convert to knapsack
    for (auto pile : piles) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = pile.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            sum += pile[i];
            weight.push_back(i+1);
            value.push_back(sum);
        }
    }

    int n = weight.size();
    auto dp = vector<vector<int>>(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= k; w++) {
            int cw = weight[i-1];   // current item's weight
            int cv = value[i-1];    // current item's value
            dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
            if (w - cw >= 0) {
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i][w], dp[i-cw][w-cw] + cv);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][k];
}
```
