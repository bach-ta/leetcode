# 206. Reverse Linked List (Easy)

```python
def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    prev, curr = None, head
    while curr:
        next = curr.next # save the next node
        curr.next = prev # reverse the link
        prev = curr # move the pointers
        curr = next # move the pointers
    return prev # curr is None, prev is the last node of the original list, so it's the new head
```
